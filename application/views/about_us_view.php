			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>eTradeInBids, LLC is a unique, privately owned web platform that links sellers of used automobiles with licensed dealers that want to buy those used vehicles. The goal is to find a more competitive way to get more for your used vehicle in an easy to use, pressure free and hassle free environment. We quickly found that having multiple dealers bid on the cars usually led to significantly higher prices than you can expect just going to the dealer that you intend to buy your new car from or, if you are a commercial entity, using one dealer to dispose of your entire used car inventory. We are dedicated to finding a better way to help consumers, financial institutions and other owners of used vehicles get the most money for their used vehicle and also eliminate the anxiety and hassle associated with this process.</p>
			<p>Our management team brings more than 75 years combined executive experience that allows us to know how to manage collaboration within the auto industry.  We are dedicated to achieving the best results and protecting individuals and companies that are looking to sell their used vehicles, while providing our registered dealers with access to a large and unique inventory of vehicles.</p>
