			<h1>Vehicle Owner Representations and Disclosures</h1>
			<p>I have elected to post a vehicle for sale using the eTradeInBids.com website and services.  I agree to be bound by the Terms of Service, the terms of which are incorporated here by this reference, and the terms of this Vehicle Owner Representations and Disclosures.</p>
			<p>I hereby represent and disclose the following regarding the vehicle that I am posting for sale on the eTradeInBids.com website:</p>
			<ol class="numeric_list">
				<li>I am the owner of the vehicle, or I am an authorized representative of the owner of the vehicle.</li>
				<li>Except for any lien holder that is referenced on the title to this vehicle, there are no other liens, claims, restrictions or contractual obligations that would prevent me from transferring this vehicle and providing good, clean title to the vehicle free of all encumbrances.</li>
				<li>The information (including the amount of any outstanding lien) and pictures regarding the vehicle that I have provided via the eTradeInBids.com website are accurate and represent a description of the actual vehicle that I am selling via the website.</li>
				<li>I hereby represent and disclose that unless otherwise expressly disclosed at the time I submit this vehicle for bid each of the following representations and disclosures regarding the vehicle that I am posting for sale on the eTradeInBids.com website is true and accurate.</li>
				<li>The vehicle has not been classified as a "Lemon-Law Buyback" or "Warranty Return" vehicle by the manufacturer of the vehicle or an authorized dealer.</li>
				<li>The vehicles odometer reading is accurate and has not been tampered with or changed in any way.</li> 
				<li>The vehicle has not been designated as a "Gross Polluter" by the State in which the vehicle is registered, and I understand that prior to any resale of the vehicle it will be tested to ensure that it meets all applicable emission standards.  To the extent the vehicle does not meet such emission standards, such failure will constitute a breach of these representations.</li>
				<li>To the best of my knowledge and except as specifically disclosed in the information that I submitted via the eTradeInBids.com website, the vehicle has not been in an accident where the damage to the vehicle has not been repaired and/or there are outstanding insurance claims that would entitle me or the vehicle owner to money that could be used to make those repairs.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If any of these representations or disclosures are determined to be untruthful, then I acknowledge that I will be liable to the purchasing Dealer.  The Dealer may elect, in its sole and absolute discretion and without limiting any other remedies that may be available in law or equity, to:</p>
			<ol class="numeric_list">
				<li>Return the vehicle to me in exchange for a return of the full purchase price paid to me by the Dealer; or</li>	
				<li>Demand from me a payment in an amount equal to the diminution in the value of the vehicle as a result of the breach of the representations set forth herein.  In other words, this amount will be determined by taking the amount paid to me and subtracting from it the actual value of the vehicle as reasonably determined by the Dealer.</li>	
			</ol>
			<p>In addition, I acknowledge that an intentional misrepresentation of the vehicle will entitle the Dealer to all damages, including punitive damages.  If the Dealer is required to defend any claims relating to or arising from the failure to make accurate disclosures or a breach of any representation set forth herein, then I agree to indemnify and defend the Dealer for any expenses or losses, including reasonable attorney fees, which may be incurred by Dealer in defending such claim.</p>	
			<p>If a dispute should arise between me and the purchasing dealer regarding the representations and disclosures that I have made regarding the vehicle or the condition of the vehicle, I agree that such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the following:</p>
			<p>IF A DISPUTE SHOULD ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND THE DEALER REGARDING THE QUALITY OF THE VEHICLE OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE VEHICLE TRANSACTION, YOU AGREE TO FIRST CONTACT ETRADEINBIDS IN WRITING WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURE OF THE DISPUTE.  ETRADEINBIDS WILL ATTEMPT TO MEDIATE THE DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE DEALER, BUT SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER OBLIGATION BEYOND ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE.  IF SUCH DISPUTE IS NOT RESOLVED WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) DAYS OF THE SUBMISSION OF THE DISPUTE TO ETRADEINBIDS, THEN YOU AND THE DEALER AGREE THAT ARBITRATION SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE METHOD TO RESOLVING THE DISPUTE AND AGREE TO SUBMIT SUCH DISPUTE TO BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION AT A LOCATION DEEMED REASONABLE BY ETRADEINBIDS BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE PARTIES.  THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE BINDING, NON-APPEALABLE AND SHALL BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.  THE ARBITRATORS FEE SHALL BE PAID BY THE LOSING PARTY AS DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR, AND EACH PARTY SHALL BEAR ALL OTHER COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEY FEES, ON ITS OWN REGARDLESS OF WHO IS THE PREVAILING PARTY.  THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE PROCEDURAL RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY OVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING HOW MUCH AND WHAT TYPES OF DISCOVERY CAN BE CONDUCTED.  ETRADEINBIDS WILL COOPERATE AND PROVIDE ANY NECESSARY DOCUMENTS OR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ARBITRATION.</p>
