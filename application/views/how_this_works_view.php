			<h1>How This Works</h1>
			<p>Itâ€™s easy, all it takes is a few simple steps to complete the sale of your car. This is how it works:</p>
			<ol class="numeric_list">
				<li>Submit your car with a few photos via our easy to use on-line system.  The more details you provide, the more confidence the dealers will have in your vehicle and the result is higher bids.</li>
				<li>Within 48 hours (often within a few hours) you should receive multiple bids for your vehicle.</li>
				<li>Review the bids at your convenience and accept the highest bid.</li>
				<li>Upon your acceptance of the bid, you have a binding agreement with the dealer to purchase your vehicle.  You will be contacted shortly to arrange for the pick-up of you vehicle by the dealer and payment to you or your vehicle lender.  Payment is made within 10 days of your acceptance of the bid.  Payment often happens much sooner.</li>
