            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			
            <p class="question">After accepting the highest offer to sell my vehicle, how long will it take for the dealer to contact me?</p>
            <p class="answer">The dealer will contact you within 72 hours to arrange a location to pick-up your vehicle.</p>	

            <p class="question">How much is this going to cost me and am I obligated to sell my car?</p>
            <p class="answer">There is no obligation to sell until you have accepted an offer and it will not cost you anything to post a car or for you to sell your car to a licensed dealer.  We collect fees only from our licensed dealers for their use of eTradeInBids.</p>
            
            <p class="question">How long will it take for a dealer to make the payment for the purchase of my vehicle?</p>
            <p class="answer"> Payment will occur within 10 days of acceptance of the bid, but often happens much sooner. For cars with clear title (i.e. no payoff or outstanding liens), payment can often occur at the time of the delivery of the car or within forty-eight hours.

            <p class="question">Where can I find the VIN number for my car?</p>
            <p class="answer">Generally, the VIN number is 17 characters long and can be found on the driver's side dashboard. It will be viewable through the windshield. Other places to consider are the driver's side door jamb, it will appear on a sticker. You may also find the VIN number on the vehicle's title (DMV) records as well as the vehicle's insurance card.</p>
            
            <p class="question">How many pictures should I upload of my car?</p>
            <p class="answer">Chances are, the more pictures that are uploaded the greater your liklihood to recieve competitive bids. Consider pictures of the exterior as well as the interior of the vehicle.</p>
            
            <p class="question">How long is the bidding process?</p>
            <p class="answer">The bidding process will take 48 hours. Once the bidding period is over, you will be notified and will have the option to accept the highest bid.</p>

            <p class="question">Can I accept the highest bid even if the bidding process is not over?</p>
            <p class="answer">You may accept a bid at any time during the bidding period.</p>

            <p class="question">What if I am not happy with any of the offers?</p>
            <p class="answer">There is no obligation to accept the highest offer.</p>

            <p class="question">Can dealers see the bids on my car?</p>
            <p class="answer">The dealers will not be able to view competitor's bids. A dealer must place a bid and will not know if it was the highest until the bidding period is closed.  Thus, dealers are incentivized to place the highest bid possible if they want to beat their competition.</p>

            <p class="question">Can dealers see my contact information during the bidding process?</p>
            <p class="answer">The dealers do not know who the owner is.</p>
