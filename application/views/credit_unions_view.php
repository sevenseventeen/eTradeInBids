			<h1>What do I do with my existing car?</h1>
			<p>Today there are thousands of credit union members contemplating selling or trading-in their current car.  If they sell through on-line channels, the members risk unscrupulous potential buyers with multiple motives for wanting to buy that car or meet that member.  There are not only financial risks in the funds used to pay could be fraudulent, but there are personal and property damage risks as well.  There is story after story from simply robbing the seller, to stealing the car and even home invasions. <strong>It is not worth it!</strong></p>
			<p>When trading a car in, your members are at the mercy of whatever the seller of the new car is willing to offer.  Except for with the very strong negotiator, there is very little power when comes to getting the most for their car. Do you have a trade-in solution for your members? Would you like to know when a member is going to sell their current car?</p>

For the third car and going forward, I am not wasting my time anywhere else. It was easy and I felt safe and in control!"</em> <br /><strong>-D. Lepre</strong></p>
