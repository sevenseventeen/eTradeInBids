			<p>To sell a vehicle or vehicles, follow the easy registration process. Once a login account is created, simply submit the car with a few photos on our easy on-line system. The more details, the better the bids.</p> 
			<p>Wait for up to 5 real bids usually within hours</p>
			<p>Accept or decline the highest bid, there is no obligation</p>
			<p>If you accept, the system will swap contact information and the approved dealer will the contact you shortly to make the final arrangements to pay for and pick up your vehicle. Itâ€™s that easy!</p>
